Jobs was able to roll out \\nMark Twain\\u2019s famous quip a few days later at his \\nannual music event. \\u201cReports of my death are greatly \\nexaggerated,\\u201d he said, as he launched a line of new \\niPods. But his gaunt appearance was not reassuring. \\nBy early October the stock price had sunk to $97.\\n \\nThat month Doug Morris of Universal Music was \\nscheduled to meet with Jobs at Apple. Instead Jobs \\ninvited him to his house. Morris was surprised to see \\nhim so ill and in pain. Morris was about to be honored \\nat a gala in Los Angeles for City of Hope, which raised \\nmoney to \\ufb01ght cancer, and he wanted Jobs to be there. \\nCharitable events were something Jobs avoided, but he \\ndecided to do it, both for Morris and for the cause. At the \\nevent, held in a big tent on Santa Monica beach, Morris \\ntold the two thousand guests that Jobs w\\n, his friend from the original Macintosh \\nteam, on devising new digital technologies that worked \\nat the pixel level to allow people to take great \\nSteve Jobs by Walter Isaacson\\n719\\nphotographs using their iPhones even in situations \\nwithout much light. And he very much wanted to do for \\ntelevision sets what he had done for computers, music \\nplayers, and phones: make them simple and elegant. \\n\\u201cI\\u2019d like to create an integrated television set that is \\ncompletely easy to use,\\u201d he told me. \\u201cIt would be \\nseamlessly synced with all of your devices and with \\niCloud.\\u201d No longer would users have to \\ufb01ddle with \\ncomplex remotes for DVD players and cable channels. \\n\\u201cIt will have the simplest user interface you could \\nimagine. I \\ufb01nally cracked it.\\u201d\\n \\nBut by July 2011, his cancer had spread to his \\nbones and other parts of his body, and his doctors were \\nhaving trouble \\ufb01nding targeted drugs that could beat it \\nback. He was in pain, sleeping erratically, had little \\nenergy, and stopped going to work.\\ncancer or your \\nplight, to mask them is to lead an arti\\ufb01cial life.\\u201d In fact he \\nswung to the other extreme. He became morose, \\ntearful, and dramatic as he lamented to all around him \\nthat he was about to die. The depression became part \\nof the vicious cycle by making him even less likely to \\neat.\\n \\nPictures and videos of Jobs looking emaciated \\nbegan to appear online, and soon rumors were swirling \\nSteve Jobs by Walter Isaacson\\n712\\nabout how sick he was. The problem, Powell realized, \\nwas that the rumors were true, and they were not going \\nto go away. Jobs had agreed only reluctantly to go on \\nmedical leave two years earlier, when his liver was \\nfailing, and this time he also resisted the idea. It would \\nbe like leaving his homeland, unsure that he would \\never return. When he \\ufb01nally bowed to the inevitable, in \\nJanuary 2011, the board members were expecting it; \\nthe telephone meeting in which he told them that he \\nwanted another leave took only three minutes. He had \\noften discussed wi\\n \\u201cThis is Steve Jobs,\\u201d he began. \\u201cYou think I\\u2019m \\nSteve Jobs by Walter Isaacson\\n623\\nan arrogant asshole who thinks he\\u2019s above the law, and \\nI think you\\u2019re a slime bucket who gets most of his facts \\nwrong.\\u201d After that rather arresting opening, Jobs offered \\nup some information about his health, but only if Nocera \\nwould keep it off the record. Nocera honored the \\nrequest, but he was able to report that, while Jobs\\u2019s \\nhealth problems amounted to more than a common \\nbug, \\u201cthey weren\\u2019t life-threatening and he doesn\\u2019t have \\na recurrence of cancer.\\u201d Jobs had given Nocera more \\ninformation than he was willing to give his own board \\nand shareholders, but it was not the full truth.\\n \\nPartly due to concern about Jobs\\u2019s weight loss, \\nApple\\u2019s stock price drifted from $188 at the beginning of \\nJune 2008 down to $156 at the end of July.
